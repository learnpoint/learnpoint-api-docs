Migration from Learnpoint Bulk API to Learnpoint API v3
========================================

Learnpoint Bulk API is deprecated and will be replaced with Learnpoint API v3.

Documentation for Learnpoint API v3: [https://api.learnpoint.se/swagger](https://api.learnpoint.se/swagger)

Braking changes from version 2 to 3
-----------------------------------

### Learnpoint Bulk API --> Learnpoint API

The structure of the endpoints are changed and the term "Bulk" is removed. In version 3 you can fetch single items and specific sets of items.

You fetch objects from one endpoint and fetch related data from another endpoint. You can post a filter with Ids to get the objects you want from the /lookup or /filter endpoints. See the [documentation for Learnpoint API v3](https://api.learnpoint.se/swagger).

Example (fetch active students and their program enrollments):
* Fetch Active students: GET /users?IncludeActive=true&includeInactive=false&IncludeStudents=true&IncludeStaff=false
  * Returns for example four users with Id 3, 5, 9 and 12.
* Fetch program enrollments for the returned users: POST /programenrollments/filter RequestBody={"UserIds": [3,5,9,12]}
  * Returns for example five program enrollments (one student is enrolled in two programs) on two different program instances with Id 2 and 5.
* Fetch the program instances returned: POST /programinstances/lookup RequestBody={"Ids": [2,5]}


### Programs and Courses

In version 2 there was only groups. You had to parse groups to find ProgramInstances and CourseInstances and use GroupMemeberships to get the students on a ProgramInstances or a CourseInstance. 

In version 3 are groups replaced by specific endpoints for ProgramInstances and CourseInstances. The student memberships on programs and courses are fetched from ProgramEnrollments and CourseEnrollments. Staff on programs and courses are fetched from ProgramStaffMemberships and CourseStaffMemberships. 

In version 2 CourseDefinitions was returnd as Reference data in the Groups endpoint. In version 3 CourseDefinitions has a separate endpoint.

Example (fetch active program enrollments and info about the students and program instances):
* Fetch Active program enrollments: GET /programenrollments?includeEnrolled=true&includeUnenrolled=false
  * Returns for example four users with Id 121, 233, 254 and 312 with enrollments in program instances with id 756 and 784.
* Fetch the users returned: POST /users/lookup RequestBody={"Ids": [121,233,254,312]}
* Fetch the program instances returned: POST /programinstances/lookup RequestBody={"Ids": [756,784]}


### ProgramInstance.Location instead of location groups

In version 2 there was location groups. ProgramInstances could have a parent reference to a location group.

In version 3 the Location is a property on the ProgramInstances.


### Student and StaffMember --> User

Student and StaffMember are replaced with a User. **The User.Id can differ from Student.Id and StaffMember.Id**.

The Id differ if the student or staff was created earlier then 2020-09-22.

UserId is added to Student And StaffMember in version 2.8 for migrating purpose.

* User.Id differ from Student.Id and StaffMember.Id if it was created before 2020-09-22
* Student.MobilePhone is renamed to User.Phone
* Student.HomePhone is renamed to User.Phone2
* Student.HomeAddress is removed
* FullStudent.EducationPlans has its own endpoint called ProgramEnrollments
* StaffMember.MobilePhone is renamed to User.Phone
* StaffMember.MayExposeMobilePhoneToStudents is removed
* StaffMember.MayExposePhone2ToStudents is removed
* FullStudent.Groups and FullStaffMember.Groups are removed and replaced with endpoints for ProgramEnrollments, CourseEnrollments, ProgramStaffMemberships and CourseStaffMemberships.

**OBSERVE! If you have users created before 2020-09-22 you cannot use the fetched StudentId or StaffMemberId as UserId. You have to translate the StudentId and StaffMemberId to the corresponding UserId or add a new property for UserId before you switch to version 3. UserId is added to Student and StaffMember in version 2.8 for migration purpose.**


### StudentEducationPlan --> ProgramEnrollment

StudentEducationPlan is renamed to ProgramEnrollment and has its own endpoint. It has a new Id that differs from StudentEducationPlan.Id.

ProgramEnrollmentId is added to StudentEducationPlan in version 2.8 for migrating purpose.

* StudentEducationPlan.Id differs from ProgramEnrollment.Id
* The EducationPlan Parts collection is removed and replaced with a ProgramInstanceId and a collection of SelectedSpecializationIds.
  * See the [documentation for Learnpoint API v3](https://api.learnpoint.se/swagger)
* StudentEducationPlanState is replaced with Enrolled and Unenrolled date and a boolean for Passed

**OBSERVE! You cannot use the fetched StudentEducationPlanId as ProgramEnrollmentId. You have to translate the StudentEducationPlanId to the corresponding ProgramEnrollmentId or add a new property for ProgramEnrollmentId before you switch to version 3. ProgramEnrollmentId is added to StudentEducationPlan in version 2.8 for migrating purpose.**


### Reference data are removed

In version 2 the endpoints included lightweight reference data.

In version 3 the endpoints returns an object or a  collection of objects. Corresponding data are fetched from the other endpoints using the /lookup and /filter endpoints.


### Date and time format

Timestamps are formated as described in RFC3339.

* Date and time are separated by a T
* Time zone are described with Z for UTC or - + offset
* Examples: 2019-11-19T13:20:50.52Z 2019-11-19T14:20:50.52+01:00

Time zone are required for date-time request parameters.

Date-time are returned as UTC in the response.
